                RANDOM Variables

A random variable is a numerical quantity whose value is determined by the outcome of a 
random phenomenon or probability experiment.

result of the experiment.

It ia a real valued function defined on a sample space.

Examples:
 the When a die is rolled twice, the random variable, X, could be defined as the 
lesser  of the 2 outcomes. The values that X can take are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
