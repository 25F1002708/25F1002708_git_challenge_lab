                            DISCRETE RANDOM Variables

Discrete random variables are random variables that can take at most a countable number of 
possible values.

A discrete random variable is a variable that can only take on a specific, countable number 
of distinct values, often whole numbers. These values are typically determined by counting,
 rather than measuring, and are used to describe outcomes of a random experiment, such as 
 the number of heads in three coin flips (0, 1, 2, or 3) or the score on a die roll 
 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).  

 Key Characteristics
Countable Values: The possible outcomes can be listed, even if the list is infinitely long 
(countably infinite). 
Distinct Outcomes: Each value is a separate, distinct point, unlike continuous variables 
which can take on any value within a range. 
Result of Counting: Discrete variables often arise from counting events, such as the number
 of customers in a store or the number of defective items in a sample.
