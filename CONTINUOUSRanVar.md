                    CONTINUOUS RANDOM Variables

A continuous random variable is a variable that can assume any value within a given range, representing quantities that are not countable but measurable, such as height, weight, or temperature. Unlike discrete variables that have separate, distinct values, a continuous variable can take on an infinite, uncountable number of values within an interval. Because it can take on so many values, the probability of it taking any exact single value is zero, and its distribution is described by a continuous function, such as a probability density function (PDF). 

Key Characteristics
Infinite & Uncountable Values: Continuous random variables can take on any value within a range, not just specific points. 
Measurement-Based: These variables are associated with physical measurements, like length, time, or mass. 
Zero Probability for Exact Values: The probability of a continuous random variable being equal to any specific exact value is always 0, as there are infinitely many possibilities. 
Probability Density Function (PDF): Instead of probabilities at specific points, their behavior is described by a continuous PDF over an interval, where the area under the curve represents probability. 
Interval Probabilities: You can only find a non-zero probability for a continuous random variable falling within a range or an interval.
